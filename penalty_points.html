            Formula 1’s penalty points system is in place
            to keep driver behaviour under control,
            in the same way as regular road users,
            with 12 points on their FIA Super Licence
            over a 12-month period
            resulting in a one-race ban.
        </p>
        <p>
            Penalty points are issued for driver transgressions,
            with the amount varying depending on the severity of the incident and,
            once a year has passed since that particular offence,
            their points get wiped,
            meaning they have to be careful
            to avoid crossing that fateful 12-point threshold.
        </p>

            The F1 penalty points system was introduced in 2014
            after Romain Grosjean received a one-race ban in 2012
            for his terrible driving and being a menace.
            F1 decided that having a points system in place
            would be a systematic way of punishing drivers,
            rather than the stewards deciding that “enough is enough”.
